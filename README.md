# Machine-Learning-Project-1
- This is my first Machine Learning project.
- Here I have collected a dataset consisting of the SONAR data and I  have to train the machine learning model to predict whether the given data is of a rock or a mine
- This  type of learning is known as Supervised learning
- The accuracy score of the model is near about 77% which is assumed to be a good accuracy score
